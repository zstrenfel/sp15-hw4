# Spring 2015 Homework 4

## Overall Spec

The overall thing that needs to be accomplished is:
- Create a dog model that stores name and age
- Validate the dog has a name and age
- Going to "/dogs" will go to an index view of all the dogs in the database
- Going to "/dogs/1" will go to a show view of the dog with id 1.  This should work for any arbitrary id.
- Going to "/dogs/new" will go to a working form that will allow me to create a dog and redirect me to the new dogs show view

## Getting Started
To start everything off, fork this repository - there should be a fork button on the top right corner of the repo.
Fork the repository to your own!

Run this command to clone this repository <b>after you fork:</b>
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sp15-hw2
```

Afterwards, change directory into the folder and run
```
rails server
```

## Just a note
  There is the annotated code of how to do the same process for creating all this functionality for a user.  The only difference
  is there is an integer (the dogs age) involved.

## Submitting

Run the following commands in your repo
```
git add .
git commit -am "I'M DONE"
```

and fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X9hN_QxenSULe-cWQIVWWJuholodQEp_wxSATBRzPPY/viewform).
